# Hello, just a message from me:

If you could not already tell, Wineorc is deprecated and has been for a long time already. However, I feel I have to make this clear because I keep hearing about this:

Wineorc is very dead and I do not condone the use of any of the revivals inside of it, whether they are alive or not. I'm not stopping you from still using them or forking this script and adding your own however.

And also another thing: I have heard some things about people who run said revivals inside of the script still continuing to use Wineorc and promote it. Whether they are doing this intentionally or not, I politely ask that you stop now. I legally own the copyright for this so I can do what I want.

That is all,

God bless.
