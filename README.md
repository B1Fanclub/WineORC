# üç∑ A simple Shell script to setup ORC revivals automatically on Linux.

This script is not supported in any way, shape or form by the official devs of these revivals.

## ‚ö° What this does
This script will download dependencies, register URI and install the revival of choice. It can also install DXVK, and uninstall the revival of choice.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements
The needed packages are:
- `sudo`
- The latest WINE (obv, preferably wine-staging)
- `wget`
- `unzip` (for Itteblox only)

The script can install WINE for you. However, only some distros are supported, so if it fails then you should install WINE and the other dependencies manually.

## üíª How to use it

1. Download the latest release from the Releases page (or just clone this repo via git)
2. Open a terminal and cd into where the script is downloaded.
3. Run `chmod +x wineorc.sh`
4. Run `./wineorc.sh` and follow the prompts.
5. Once installed, play a game and it should work!

See `./wineorc.sh --help` for all available options.

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting
If the revival crashes/doesn't launch, try to:

1. Run the latest version of the installer again (make sure you're running it as non-root)
2. Make sure all necessary optional wine dependencies are installed https://wiki.winehq.org/Building_Wine#Satisfying_Build_Dependencies

If those don't work, DM me on Discord: DarDarDar#3429.
